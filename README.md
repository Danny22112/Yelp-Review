# Machine Learning with Text in scikit-learn

## Overview
This project covers key aspects of applying machine learning techniques to text data using scikit-learn. The goal is to understand how to represent text data numerically, build and evaluate models, and fine-tune the workflow to improve performance.

## Agenda

1. **Model building in scikit-learn**  
   A quick overview of scikit-learn for those new to the library, including a refresher on model building.

2. **Representing text as numerical data**  
   Text data cannot be directly used by machine learning models. We'll explore how to convert text into a format that can be processed by models.

3. **Reading a text-based dataset into pandas**  
   Learn how to load text data using pandas for easier manipulation and preprocessing.

4. **Vectorizing our dataset**  
   Transform the text data into numerical form using vectorization techniques like `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfVectorizer`.

5. **Building and evaluating a model**  
   Train and evaluate machine learning models on the vectorized dataset.

6. **Comparing models**  
   Compare the performance of different models to understand their strengths and weaknesses.

7. **Examining a model for further insight**  
   Dig deeper into the results of a trained model and understand what features are influencing its predictions.

8. **Practicing this workflow on another dataset**  
   Practice applying this workflow to a new, real-world text dataset.

9. **Tuning the vectorizer (discussion)**  
   Explore how fine-tuning the vectorizer can help improve model performance and discuss the trade-offs.
